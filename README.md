# Eclipse Liberty Project Helper â€” Importer Plugin


This plugin helps Open Liberty contributors use Eclipse to develop Open Liberty.

Open Liberty has thousands of projects, and a contributor may want to work on only a few of these.
This plugin lets the user choose projects to work on, and import just the necessary projects to safely and effectively edit the code they are interested in.
